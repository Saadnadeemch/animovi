# 🎬 Animated Streaming Website (Angular 18 + Firebase)

A modern streaming platform UI built with Angular 18, Tailwind, SSR, and real-time Firebase integration.  
The entire interface is fully animated, highly polished, and crafted to deliver a streaming experience that feels fast, smooth, and genuinely fun to use.

This project pulls its data from Firebase in real time and works hand-in-hand with a custom backend CRM panel where movies, categories, and metadata are managed.

## 🌟 Overview

This project was built as a complete front-end experience for a streaming website.  
It includes everything you would expect from a modern streaming platform:

- A responsive, Netflix-style homepage  
- Smooth animated transitions  
- A detailed movie screen with full info  
- Live search that reacts instantly  
- Category-based browsing  
- Server-side rendering for SEO  
- Real-time data powered by Firebase  

Originally, the content library had 60+ movies hosted on Google Drive.  
Many were later removed due to Drive's policy limits — the platform now uses **embed links**, making it flexible enough to stream content from **any external hosting provider**.
